# Synthetic Text Detection and Text Similarities

Text or Sentence Similarity determins how similar two texts or sentences are. Text similarity models convert input texts into vectors or embeddings that capture semantic information and calculate how close or similar they are. Metrics of similarity include cosine similarity, jaccard similarity, and several others.

Synthetic text detection is the process of identifying text that has been generated by a computer, as opposed to being written by a human. This can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as detecting spam emails, identifying fake news articles, or detecting automated social media accounts. -from ChatGPT :-)

In the demo, we will combine both approaches to see if a response to a given prompt was machine-generated.

## Project Details

## Instructions

1. Install base requirements from the repo's main [README.md](https://github.com/bohoro/ApplyMetaAI/blob/main/README.md).
2. Install sentence transformers

    ```bash
    pip install -U sentence-transformers
    pip install openai
    ```

3. Test the install.

    ```bash
    python test_st_inference.py
    ```

    Cosine-Similarity: tensor([[0.6153]])

4. Place your OpenAI api key in the env var OAI_TOKEN

    ```bash
    export OAI_TOKEN=XXXYYYZZZ
    ```

5. Run the app

    ```bash
    streamlit run answer_checker.py --server.port 9999
    ```
