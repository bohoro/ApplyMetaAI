You were elected to represent your constituents because your values and your commitment to social justice have helped to keep a critical portion of America together against a president who is not only unqualified but actively hostile to it. You are not representative of the Republican Party, although you claim otherwise. You were elected to represent a diverse body of Americans. Your constituents believe that you represent them. They trust you. They are not going to trust your government. In the months and years ahead, they will insist that you stand up to President Trump, even if his actions in office have proven otherwise. But that will take courage on their part. For now, you have to choose. The choice you face is clear. You must choose one party over the other. To be clear, neither of them offer you any reason to be afraid.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I'm not sure whether this is the official position of the Democratic Party, but they're right when they claim that Trump's election would have been an abject catastrophe for the Democratic Party because he has \"shown that he is unqualified and unfriendly toward women.\" And while they're correct that they don't seem to understand that in a democratic republic like ours, candidates and government employees are elected by elections and not by popularity contests with voters, which is why the electoral college actually does a pretty good job of electing presidents.\n",
       "\n",
       "What they should be saying, instead, is that Trump's election was a disaster for their party. Why? Because the Democratic Party has failed to appeal to white Americans, the voters that Trump won. The party's presidential candidates failed to make common cause with white conservatives, and its presidential nominee refused to do that either. The party's presidential nominee did not reach out to women or minorities or immigrants or people of color. He did not appeal to the common ground they need. Trump, in other words, is not \"unqualified.\" He is a dangerous idiot, and the Democrats need to distance themselves from him in order to be more appealing to Republicans.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trump's victory in November has brought with it a sense that the Democrats, and the Democratic Party in particular, have failed its core voters. While some of Trump's supporters may believe that this was simply because they felt cheated by the system and won't accept the results, there's a good deal more to it than that. One of the first things you realize when you vote for an unpopular president is that the system has screwed you. The electoral college gave him the victory. The Democrats, by contrast, managed to do a reasonably decent job of turning out their electoral base. So, for better or worse, they weren't completely at fault.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, in my opinion, the Democrats' failure to appeal to white Americans was a mistake, whether they realize it or not. In particular, it was a mistake on three levels. First, that the Democrats thought that by catering to white voters they were, somehow, going to change the fundamental equation of our nationâ€”the United States as a nation for people of color, not white people. They just don't get it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Secondly, they thought that white American racists wanted an alternative to Trump. The fact is there's not that many racist white people in America. In 2016, the American average is 4.7 racists per 10,000 people. That's the least racist country in the world. The problem of racism doesn't have to be limited to white people in this country. Racism exists among any segment of the population. By catering to white voters, the Democratic Party undermined its most important constituency.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, the Democrats realized that their appeal was limited to those white voters, so they didn't try to appeal to other groups of whites in this country, like Latinos and African Americans, as well. When Latinos and African Americans vote for Democrats, they do so in droves, showing that even Democrats don't live in monoliths any more.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, to summarize: the Democratic Party's 2016 election strategy was to appeal to white voters to become Democrats. As a result, Trump won the national popular vote more than 4 million more times than Clinton. But the party didn't come anywhere close to winning white voters. This is part of the reason that Clinton lost the election, a reason that I've written about here and here.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the Democrats' new slogan proclaims, what's the best way to fight back against a president who is a bigot, a liar, a misogynist, and an Islamophobe? By appealing to white voters. And they've done a pretty decent job of it so far.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in a democracy, that doesn't necessarily mean that the Democratic Party must win over people who support or are affiliated with white nationalists. But that doesn't mean that the Democratic Party can't fight for those who are non-white. That won't hurt the Democrats in any meaningful way, and for their part, the Republicans must not adopt a racially ambiguous \"</td>\n",

England Ashes squad 1/17 Captain: Joe Root England's Mr Dependable will lead his side into an Ashes series for the first time, and while he has the experience of the series wins in 2013 and 2015, he also has the scars of the last trip Down Under. Getty 2/17 Batsman: Alastair Cook The former captain will be crucial to England's hopes, with the Essex opener needing to find the same resilient form that he displayed in Australia in the 2010/11 series. Getty 3/17 Batsman: Mark Stoneman Cook's likely opening partner will be Mark Stoneman after selectors decided to stick with him despite a nervous series against the West Indies. Getty 4/17 Batsman/spinner: Dawid Malan Malan showed glimpses of promise this summer and can also offer an option with the ball, but he is untested on the hard pitches of Australia and could be found out. Getty 5/17 Batsman: Gary Ballance Ballance is handed yet another chance to salvage his England career as the selectors hope he will eventually come good for their unyielding faith. Getty 6/17 Batsman: James Vince Vince is the surprise inclusion in the squad, having done little of note in county cricket since being dropped in 2016. Getty 7/17 Batsman/spinner: Moeen Ali Moeen Ali could easily go on to be man of the series given his ability to deliver fireworks with bat and ball. He may disagree, but he is undoubtedly England's front line spinner. Getty 8/17 Batsman/spinner: Mason Crane Crane is yet to make his full debut, though took a wonderful catch against the West Indies as a substitute fielder and will head to Australia as a back-up leg-break spiner bowler. Getty 9/17 Wicketkeeper: Ben Foakes Foakes will head to Australia as a deputy for first-choice wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. Getty 10/17 Wicketkeeper: Jonny Bairstow Another man who will need to produce runs to give England a chance of victory, with his ability in the mid-order giving the tourists a bite throughout the line-up. Getty 11/17 All-rounder: Ben Stokes Stokes is named in the side despite falling under a huge cloud after his arrest on a late night out in Bristol. His future as vice-captain looks very much in doubt. Getty 12/17 All-rounder: Chris Woakes Woakes will provide rest for the front-line bowlers and will also prove handy with the bat. Getty 13/17 Bowler: Stuart Broad Broad has long set his sights on this Ashes tour as he hopes to make up for the 2013/14 humiliation, and his opening partnership with James Anderson will set the tone for how England will cope out in Australia. Getty 14/17 Bowler: James Anderson England's leading Test wicket-taker will be wrapped in cotton wool until the first Test, though he will have to deliver the goods in a country where swing can be hard to find. Getty 15/17 Bowler: Jake Ball Ball could prove to be England's joke in the pack given his extra pace and bounce. Think Chris Tremlett a la 2010/11. It's just a case of keeping him fit. Getty 16/17 Bowler: Craig Overton The third uncapped member of the squad, Overton has been rewarded for a solid season with Somerset. Getty 17/17 Bowler: Tom Curran Called up by England to replace Steven Finn, who had previously been called up due to Ben Stokes' uncertainty. Getty 1/17 Captain: Joe Root England's Mr Dependable will lead his side into an Ashes series for the first time, and while he has the experience of the series wins in 2013 and 2015, he also has the scars of the last trip Down Under.
